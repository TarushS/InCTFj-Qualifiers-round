Find the vulnerability and escape the loop. 

You are provided the binary/executable and the source code. 

Just like the previous challenge, the challenge is hosted in a remote server where you can get the flag. Figure out the solution locally and then provide the same solution to the remotely hosted service.

Run the below shell command in your terminal, which is in the format " $ nc <HOST> <PORT> " , to communicate with remote executable. 

nc 13.233.178.121 6789
